what are various SQL joins? with examples

There are four types of SQL joins:

INNER JOIN: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
Example: Suppose we have two tables, Customers and Orders, and we want to get a list of all customers and their orders.

SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
LEFT JOIN: Returns all the rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned.
Example: Suppose we have two tables, Customers and Orders, and we want to get a list of all customers and their orders, including customers who have not placed any orders.

SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
RIGHT JOIN: Returns all the rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned.
Example: Suppose we have two tables, Customers and Orders, and we want to get a list of all orders and their customers, including orders that have not been placed by any customer.

SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all the rows from both tables, including those that do not have a match in the other table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned.
Example: Suppose we have two tables, Customers and Orders, and we want to get a list of all customers and their orders, including customers who have not placed any orders and orders that have not been placed by any customer.

SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;

how to persist json nested object data into snowflake table in flatten columns?

To persist JSON nested object data into Snowflake table in flatten columns, you can follow the steps below:

Create a table in Snowflake with columns that match the flattened JSON object. For example, if your JSON object has fields "name", "age", "address.city", and "address.state", you would create a table with columns "name", "age", "city", and "state".

Load the JSON data into a Snowflake staging area. You can use the COPY INTO command to load the JSON data into a temporary staging table in Snowflake.

Use the PARSE_JSON function to extract the nested fields from the JSON object. For example, to extract the "address.city" field, you would use the following query:

SELECT PARSE_JSON(json_column):address:city AS city
FROM staging_table;

Insert the flattened data into the Snowflake table using the INSERT INTO command. For example, the following query would insert the flattened data into the Snowflake table:

INSERT INTO target_table (name, age, city, state)
SELECT name, age, PARSE_JSON(json_column):address:city AS city, PARSE_JSON(json_column):address:state AS state
FROM staging_table;

Note that the PARSE_JSON function is used to extract the nested fields from the JSON object. The syntax for accessing nested fields in a JSON object is :field1:field2:field3.

how would the above work if the nested json structure has array of objects?

If the nested JSON structure has an array of objects, you can use the FLATTEN function in Snowflake to unnest the array and create multiple rows for each object in the array. Here's an example of how you can persist JSON nested object data into Snowflake table in flatten columns when the nested structure has an array of objects:

Create a table in Snowflake with columns that match the flattened JSON object structure. For example, if your JSON object has fields "name", "age", and "address.city" and an array of objects for "phoneNumbers" with fields "type" and "number", you would create a table with columns "name", "age", "city", "phone_type", and "phone_number".

Load the JSON data into a Snowflake staging area. You can use the COPY INTO command to load the JSON data into a temporary staging table in Snowflake.

Use the PARSE_JSON function to extract the nested fields from the JSON object, including the array of objects. For example, to extract the "phoneNumbers" array, you would use the following query:

SELECT PARSE_JSON(json_column):phoneNumbers AS phoneNumbers
FROM staging_table;

Use the FLATTEN function to unnest the array of objects and create multiple rows for each object in the array. For example, the following query would unnest the "phoneNumbers" array and create multiple rows for each object in the array:

SELECT name, age, PARSE_JSON(json_column):address:city AS city, phoneNumber.value:type AS phone_type, phoneNumber.value:number AS phone_number
FROM staging_table, LATERAL FLATTEN(PARSE_JSON(json_column):phoneNumbers) phoneNumber;

Insert the flattened data into the Snowflake table using the INSERT INTO command. For example, the following query would insert the flattened data into the Snowflake table:

INSERT INTO target_table (name, age, city, phone_type, phone_number)
SELECT name, age, PARSE_JSON(json_column):address:city AS city, phoneNumber.value:type AS phone_type, phoneNumber.value:number AS phone_number
FROM staging_table, LATERAL FLATTEN(PARSE_JSON(json_column):phoneNumbers) phoneNumber;

Note that the LATERAL keyword is used in conjunction with the FLATTEN function to ensure that the unnesting of the array is performed correctly. The syntax for accessing fields in an array of objects in a JSON object is :array_field[index]:object_field.

show be an example for the above to understand how LATERAL and FLATTEN would work?

Sure, here's an example to illustrate how the LATERAL and FLATTEN functions work when dealing with arrays of nested objects in JSON:

Let's say you have the following JSON object:

{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "address": {
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY"
  },
  "phoneNumbers": [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "555-1234"
    },
    {
      "type": "work",
      "number": "555-5678"
    }
  ]
}
And you want to persist this data into a Snowflake table with columns "name", "age", "city", "phone_type", and "phone_number".

To do this, you can use the following SQL query:

CREATE TABLE my_table (
  name VARCHAR(50),
  age INT,
  city VARCHAR(50),
  phone_type VARCHAR(50),
  phone_number VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO my_table
SELECT
  name,
  age,
  address:city AS city,
  phone_number.value:type AS phone_type,
  phone_number.value:number AS phone_number
FROM my_json_table,
LATERAL FLATTEN(PARSE_JSON(json_column):phoneNumbers) phone_number;
Here's how this query works:

First, we create a new table "my_table" with columns "name", "age", "city", "phone_type", and "phone_number".

Next, we use the INSERT INTO statement to insert data into "my_table" by selecting data from the staging table "my_json_table".

In the SELECT statement, we use the PARSE_JSON function to parse the JSON data in the "json_column" column of "my_json_table".

We extract the "name", "age", and "address.city" fields from the JSON object using the ":" notation.

We then use the FLATTEN function to unnest the "phoneNumbers" array of objects. This creates a new row for each object in the array, while still maintaining the values of the other columns.

Finally, we use the ":" notation again to extract the "type" and "number" fields from each object in the "phoneNumbers" array.

Note that the LATERAL keyword is used with the FLATTEN function to ensure that the unnesting of the array is done correctly. This allows us to reference other columns in the same query, such as the "name" and "age" columns.

how many records are created in snowflake for the example? show me the table output

For the example I provided, the Snowflake table output would be as follows:

| name | age | city      | phone_type | phone_number |
|------|-----|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| John | 30  | New York | home      | 555-1234     |
| John | 30  | New York | work      | 555-5678     |
As you can see, there are two records created in the "my_table" Snowflake table, one for each object in the "phoneNumbers" array. The "name", "age", and "city" fields are the same for both records, while the "phone_type" and "phone_number" fields differ based on the values in the "phoneNumbers" array.

how does the staging table (my_json_table) looks for above example

The staging table "my_json_table" for the above example would contain a single row with the JSON object data in a single column. Here's an example of what the staging table might look like:

| json_column                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| {"name": "John", "age": 30, "address": {"city": "New York", "state": "NY"}, "phoneNumbers": [{"type": "home", "number": "555-1234"}, {"type": "work", "number": "555-5678"}]} |
As you can see, the "json_column" column contains the entire JSON object as a single string. This is the data that will be loaded into the staging table using the COPY INTO command before it is processed further using the SQL query I provided earlier.

in the above final snowflake table (my_table) since one JSON records is converted into 2 records based on phone number array data, I see other columns name, city, age are duplicated ...
is there a way to improve this?

Yes, you're correct that in the final Snowflake table "my_table", the columns "name", "age", and "city" are duplicated since there are multiple rows generated for each JSON record.

To avoid this duplication, you can use Snowflake's VARIANT data type to store the entire JSON object in a single column in the table, along with the flattened columns. This approach allows you to store the entire JSON object in a single row, while still being able to query and filter on individual fields within the JSON object.

Here's an example of how you can create a Snowflake table using the VARIANT data type:

CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT,
  json_data VARIANT,
  phone_type VARCHAR(50),
  phone_number VARCHAR(50)
);
In this example, we've added an "id" column to uniquely identify each row in the table, a "json_data" column of VARIANT data type to store the entire JSON object, and the flattened columns "phone_type" and "phone_number".

To insert data into this table, you can use the following SQL query:

INSERT INTO my_table (id, json_data, phone_type, phone_number)
SELECT
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY json_column),
  PARSE_JSON(json_column),
  phone_number.value:type AS phone_type,
  phone_number.value:number AS phone_number
FROM my_json_table,
LATERAL FLATTEN(PARSE_JSON(json_column):phoneNumbers) phone_number;
Here, we're using the PARSE_JSON function to parse the JSON data in the "json_column" column of the staging table, and then inserting the entire JSON object into the "json_data" column of the target table.

By doing this, we're able to avoid duplicating the "name", "age", and "city" columns in the target table, while still being able to query and filter on individual fields within the JSON object using Snowflake's JSON functions.

how would the final data in my_table look?

The final data in the "my_table" Snowflake table would look like this:

| id | json_data                                                                                                                         | phone_type | phone_number |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------|
| 1  | {"name": "John", "age": 30, "address": {"city": "New York", "state": "NY"}, "phoneNumbers": [{"type": "home", "number": "555-1234"}, {"type": "work", "number": "555-5678"}]} | home       | 555-1234     |
| 2  | {"name": "John", "age": 30, "address": {"city": "New York", "state": "NY"}, "phoneNumbers": [{"type": "home", "number": "555-1234"}, {"type": "work", "number": "555-5678"}]} | work       | 555-5678     |
As you can see, the "name", "age", and "city" fields are no longer duplicated in the Snowflake table, since we've stored the entire JSON object in the "json_data" column using the VARIANT data type. The "phone_type" and "phone_number" fields are still flattened and stored as separate columns, but they are no longer associated with duplicated "name", "age", and "city" fields.

if the above input sample json had address array and phoneNumbers as array then what is the right way of flatten the json into final snowflake table?

If the input sample JSON has both an "address" array and a "phoneNumbers" array, you can use the FLATTEN function in conjunction with the ARRAYAGG function in Snowflake to unnest the arrays and create multiple rows for each object in the arrays.

Here's an example of how you can persist JSON nested object data into Snowflake table in flatten columns when the nested structure has arrays of objects:

Create a table in Snowflake with columns that match the flattened JSON object structure. For example, if your JSON object has fields "name", "age", and an array of objects for "address" with fields "street", "city", and "state", and an array of objects for "phoneNumbers" with fields "type" and "number", you would create a table with columns "name", "age", "street", "city", "state", "phone_type", and "phone_number".

Load the JSON data into a Snowflake staging area. You can use the COPY INTO command to load the JSON data into a temporary staging table in Snowflake.

Use the PARSE_JSON function to extract the nested fields from the JSON object, including the arrays of objects. For example, to extract the "address" array and the "phoneNumbers" array, you would use the following query:

SELECT PARSE_JSON(json_column):address AS address, PARSE_JSON(json_column):phoneNumbers AS phoneNumbers
FROM staging_table;

Use the FLATTEN function to unnest the arrays of objects and create multiple rows for each object in the arrays. For example, the following query would unnest the "address" array and the "phoneNumbers" array and create multiple rows for each object in the arrays:

SELECT name, age, address.value:street AS street, address.value:city AS city, address.value:state AS state, phoneNumber.value:type AS phone_type, phoneNumber.value:number AS phone_number
FROM staging_table, LATERAL FLATTEN(PARSE_JSON(json_column):address) address, LATERAL FLATTEN(PARSE_JSON(json_column):phoneNumbers) phoneNumber;

Use the ARRAYAGG function to group the flattened data by the original fields in the JSON object. For example, the following query would group the flattened data by the "name", "age", "street", "city", "state", "phone_type", and "phone_number" fields:

SELECT name, age, ARRAYAGG(street) AS street, ARRAYAGG(city) AS city, ARRAYAGG(state) AS state, ARRAYAGG(phone_type) AS phone_type, ARRAYAGG(phone_number) AS phone_number
FROM (
SELECT name, age, address.value:street AS street, address.value:city AS city, address.value:state AS state, phoneNumber.value:type AS phone_type, phoneNumber.value:number AS phone_number
FROM staging_table, LATERAL FLATTEN(PARSE_JSON(json_column):address) address, LATERAL FLATTEN(PARSE_JSON(json_column):phoneNumbers) phoneNumber
)
GROUP BY name, age;

This query would group the flattened data by the "name" and "age" fields, and use the ARRAYAGG function to aggregate the values of the "street", "city", "state", "phone_type", and "phone_number" fields into arrays.

By using the FLATTEN and ARRAYAGG functions in Snowflake, you can easily persist JSON nested object data into Snowflake table in flatten columns when the nested structure has arrays of objects.

show me with an example of input json data for the above, staging table data, final snowflake table data

Sure, here's an example of how you can persist JSON nested object data into Snowflake table in flatten columns when the nested structure has arrays of objects:

Create a table in Snowflake with columns that match the flattened JSON object structure:
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  name VARCHAR(50),
  age INT,
  street VARCHAR(50),
  city VARCHAR(50),
  state VARCHAR(50),
  phone_type VARCHAR(50),
  phone_number VARCHAR(50)
);
Load the JSON data into a Snowflake staging area. For this example, let's assume we have the following JSON data to load:
[
  {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "address": [
      {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY"
      },
      {
        "street": "456 Elm St",
        "city": "Chicago",
        "state": "IL"
      }
    ],
    "phoneNumbers": [
      {
        "type": "home",
        "number": "555-1234"
      },
      {
        "type": "work",
        "number": "555-5678"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "Jane",
    "age": 35,
    "address": [
      {
        "street": "789 Oak St",
        "city": "San Francisco",
        "state": "CA"
      }
    ],
    "phoneNumbers": [
      {
        "type": "home",
        "number": "555-4321"
      },
      {
        "type": "work",
        "number": "555-8765"
      }
    ]
  }
]
Use the COPY INTO command to load the JSON data into a temporary staging table in Snowflake:
COPY INTO my_json_table FROM 's3://my-bucket/my-file.json' CREDENTIALS=(AWS_KEY_ID='access_key' AWS_SECRET_KEY='secret_key') FILE_FORMAT=(TYPE=JSON);
Use the PARSE_JSON function to extract the nested fields from the JSON object, including the arrays of objects:
SELECT PARSE_JSON(json_column):address AS address, PARSE_JSON(json_column):phoneNumbers AS phoneNumbers
FROM my_json_table;
Use the FLATTEN function to unnest the arrays of objects and create multiple rows for each object in the arrays:
SELECT name, age, address.value:street AS street, address.value:city AS city, address.value:state AS state, phoneNumber.value:type AS phone_type, phoneNumber.value:number AS phone_number
FROM my_json_table, LATERAL FLATTEN(PARSE_JSON(json_column):address) address, LATERAL FLATTEN(PARSE_JSON(json_column):phoneNumbers) phoneNumber;
Use the ARRAYAGG function to group the flattened data by the original fields in the JSON object:
SELECT name, age, ARRAYAGG(street) AS street, ARRAYAGG(city) AS city, ARRAYAGG(state) AS state, ARRAYAGG(phone_type) AS phone_type, ARRAYAGG(phone_number) AS phone_number
FROM (
  SELECT name, age, address.value:street AS street, address.value:city AS city, address.value:state AS state, phoneNumber.value:type AS phone_type, phoneNumber.value:number AS phone_number
  FROM my_json_table, LATERAL FLATTEN(PARSE_JSON(json_column):address) address, LATERAL FLATTEN(PARSE_JSON(json_column):phoneNumbers) phoneNumber
)
GROUP BY name, age;
The final Snowflake table data would look like this:

| name | age | street           | city           | state | phone_type | phone_number |
|------|-----|-----------------|----------------|-------|------------|--------------|
| John | 30  | 123 Main St      | New York       | NY    | home       | 555-1234     |
| John | 30  | 456 Elm St      | Chicago        | IL    | home       | 555-1234     |
| John | 30  | 123 Main St      | New York       | NY    | work       | 555-5678     |
| John | 30  | 456 Elm St      | Chicago        | IL    | work       | 555-5678     |
| Jane | 35  | 789 Oak St      | San Francisco | CA    | home       | 555-4321     |
| Jane | 35  | 789 Oak St      | San Francisco | CA    | work       | 555-8765     |
As you can see, the "address" and "phoneNumbers" arrays are flattened into separate rows, and the data is grouped by the original fields in the JSON

what is data in my_json_table ( temporary staging table) is it single record or multiple records ... show me the my_json_table output?

The data in the "my_json_table" temporary staging table would depend on how you loaded the JSON data into Snowflake. If you used the COPY INTO command to load a single JSON file, then the staging table would contain a single record with a single column containing the entire JSON object.

For example, let's assume you loaded the following JSON data into Snowflake using the COPY INTO command:

[
  {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "address": {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "New York",
      "state": "NY"
    },
    "phoneNumbers": [
      {
        "type": "home",
        "number": "555-1234"
      },
      {
        "type": "work",
        "number": "555-5678"
      }
    ]
  }
]
The "my_json_table" staging table would contain a single record with a single column containing the entire JSON object:

| json_column                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [{"name": "John", "age": 30, "address": {"street": "123 Main St", "city": "New York", "state": "NY"}, "phoneNumbers": [{"type": "home", "number": "555-1234"}, {"type": "work", "number": "555-5678"}]}] |
You could then use the PARSE_JSON function to extract the nested fields from the JSON object, as described in my previous answer.

How many records are available in data in my_json_table ( temporary staging table) based on Input Json sample provided below, show me an output of my_json_table?

below is the Input Json where it has array of 2 objects
[
{
"name": "John",
"age": 30,
"address": [
{
"street": "123 Main St",
"city": "New York",
"state": "NY"
},
{
"street": "456 Elm St",
"city": "Chicago",
"state": "IL"
}
],
"phoneNumbers": [
{
"type": "home",
"number": "555-1234"
},
{
"type": "work",
"number": "555-5678"
}
]
},
{
"name": "Jane",
"age": 35,
"address": [
{
"street": "789 Oak St",
"city": "San Francisco",
"state": "CA"
}
],
"phoneNumbers": [
{
"type": "home",
"number": "555-4321"
},
{
"type": "work",
"number": "555-8765"
}
]
}
]

Based on the input JSON provided, there are two objects in the array, so the "my_json_table" temporary staging table should have two records.

Here's an example of what the output of the "my_json_table" temporary staging table would look like:
