### _There are four types of SQL joins_:

**INNER JOIN**: 
```
Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
Example: Suppose we have two tables, Customers and Orders, and we want to get a list of all customers and their orders.
```

```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

**LEFT JOIN**: 

```
Returns all the rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned.
Example: Suppose we have two tables, Customers and Orders, and we want to get a list of all customers and their orders, including customers who have not placed any orders.
```

```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

**RIGHT JOIN**: 
```
Returns all the rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned.
Example: Suppose we have two tables, Customers and Orders, and we want to get a list of all orders and their customers, including orders that have not been placed by any customer.
```

```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

**FULL OUTER JOIN**: 
```
Returns all the rows from both tables, including those that do not have a match in the other table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned.
Example: Suppose we have two tables, Customers and Orders, and we want to get a list of all customers and their orders, including customers who have not placed any orders and orders that have not been placed by any customer.
```

```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```


explain various SQL joins?

```
SQL joins are used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are several types of SQL joins:

Inner Join: Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables based on the join condition.

Left Join: Returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there is no match in the right table, it returns NULL values.

Right Join: Returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there is no match in the left table, it returns NULL values.

Full Outer Join: Returns all the rows from both tables, including those that do not have a match in the other table. If there is no match, it returns NULL values.

Cross Join: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables, which means it returns all possible combinations between the rows of both tables.

Self Join: A self join is when a table is joined with itself. It is useful when you need to combine rows within a single table based on a related column.

The type of join you use depends on the data that you need to retrieve and the relationship between the tables. It is important to understand the differences between the types of joins to use them effectively in your SQL queries.
