Neo4j Insert Script
To convert this data into a Neo4j insert script, you can use the Cypher query language. Hereâ€™s an example script that creates nodes for persons and addresses, and then creates relationships between them:

// Create Person nodes
CREATE (p1:Person {person_id: 1, name: 'John Doe', age: 30}),
       (p2:Person {person_id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith', age: 25}),
       (p3:Person {person_id: 3, name: 'Emily Davis', age: 35});

// Create Address nodes
CREATE (a1:Address {address_id: 1, street: '123 Main St', city: 'Springfield', state: 'IL', zip: '62701'}),
       (a2:Address {address_id: 2, street: '456 Elm St', city: 'Metropolis', state: 'NY', zip: '10001'}),
       (a3:Address {address_id: 3, street: '789 Oak St', city: 'Gotham', state: 'CA', zip: '90210'});

// Create relationships between Persons and Addresses
MATCH (p1:Person {person_id: 1}), (a1:Address {address_id: 1})
CREATE (p1)-[:LIVES_AT]->(a1);

MATCH (p2:Person {person_id: 2}), (a2:Address {address_id: 2})
CREATE (p2)-[:LIVES_AT]->(a2);

MATCH (p3:Person {person_id: 3}), (a3:Address {address_id: 3})
CREATE (p3)-[:LIVES_AT]->(a3);

Explanation
Creating Person Nodes: The CREATE clause is used to create nodes for each person with their respective properties.
Creating Address Nodes: Similarly, the CREATE clause is used to create nodes for each address.
Creating Relationships: The MATCH clause is used to find the person and address nodes, and the CREATE clause is used to create relationships between them.
This script will create a graph in Neo4j where each person node is connected to their respective address node with a LIVES_AT relationship.
