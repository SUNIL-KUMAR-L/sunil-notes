### PE ratio

PE ratio or Price to Earnings ratio is a measure of how much investors are willing to pay per share of a stock based on the earnings per share. 

In simple terms, it's calculated as:

PE ratio = Stock Price / Earnings per share

A high PE ratio means investors are willing to pay more for a share, because they believe it will grow earnings and stock price in the future.
It indicates higher growth prospects.

A low PE ratio means investors are paying less for a share relative to earnings. 
It indicates a stock may be undervalued or in a declining growth industry.

PE ratio allows you to compare the value of stocks. 
A lower PE ratio could mean a stock is a bargain relative to its earnings, 
while a higher PE ratio could mean a stock's price is expensive relative to its earnings. 
However, it should be used along with other metrics to analyze stocks.

Can you give me an example of a stock with a high PE ratio?

Sure, here are some examples of stocks with typically high PE ratios:

• Technology companies like Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, etc. These companies are expected to grow earnings rapidly, so investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock. For example, Netflix currently has a PE ratio of around 50.

• Biotech or pharmaceutical companies that are researching new drugs. These companies have a risky profile, but if a drug is successful, earnings can grow very fast. So investors pay a high PE ratio hoping for that growth.

• Growth-oriented companies in industries like retail, finance, etc. For example, a company like Under Armour used to have a very high PE ratio, over 50 at one point, because of rapid growth. However, if growth slows, the PE ratio can drop quickly.

In general, high growth companies will have higher PE ratios, while stable, mature companies will have lower PE ratios. But a high PE is no guarantee of future growth, and a low PE could mean a stock is undervalued. Other factors should be considered as well.
