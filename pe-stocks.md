### PE ratio

PE ratio or Price to Earnings ratio is a measure of how much investors are willing to pay per share of a stock based on the earnings per share. 

In simple terms, it's calculated as:

PE ratio = Stock Price / Earnings per share

A high PE ratio means investors are willing to pay more for a share, because they believe it will grow earnings and stock price in the future.
It indicates higher growth prospects.

A low PE ratio means investors are paying less for a share relative to earnings. 
It indicates a stock may be undervalued or in a declining growth industry.

PE ratio allows you to compare the value of stocks. 
A lower PE ratio could mean a stock is a bargain relative to its earnings, 
while a higher PE ratio could mean a stock's price is expensive relative to its earnings. 
However, it should be used along with other metrics to analyze stocks.
